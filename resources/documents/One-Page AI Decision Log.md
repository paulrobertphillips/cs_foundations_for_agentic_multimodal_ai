Perfect — this is the **right order**.
If the Sprint Scope Contract is the *entry gate*, the **Decision Log** is the *memory* that prevents slow, silent drift.

Below is a **one-page, checklist-style Decision Log** that matches the tone, density, and intent of your other artifacts.

# 📄 **One-Page AI Decision Log**

> **Purpose**
> Record **high-impact or hard-to-reverse decisions** made during an AI-assisted sprint.
> This document exists to preserve *intent*, not to document implementation details.

> **Rule of Use**
> This log is **not filled out every sprint**.
> It is used **only when a decision materially affects behavior, assumptions, or future constraints**.

---

## 1. Decision Identification

* **Project / Repository:**
* **Sprint Name / ID:**
* **Decision Date:**
* **Decision Owner (Human):**

☐ Ownership of this decision is explicitly assigned
☐ Decision was made with human approval

---

## 2. Decision Summary (What Changed)

**Decision Statement (1–2 sentences):**

```
[Clear statement of the decision that was made]
```

☐ Decision is stated in plain language
☐ Decision describes *what*, not *how*

**Good example**

> Missing values in column `price` will be imputed using the median computed from training data only.

**Bad example**

> Improved missing value handling logic.

## 3. Rationale (Why This Decision Was Made)

**Primary reason(s):**

☐ Correctness
☐ Reproducibility
☐ Maintainability
☐ Performance
☐ Risk reduction
☐ Other: ________

**Explanation:**

```
[Brief justification linking decision to sprint goals]
```

☐ Rationale aligns with sprint intent
☐ Tradeoffs were considered

---

## 4. Assumptions Introduced or Reinforced

☐ This decision introduces new assumptions
☐ This decision reinforces existing assumptions

List assumptions explicitly:

```
- …
- …
```

☐ Assumptions are visible to future contributors
☐ Assumptions are not implicit or hidden in code

---

## 5. Scope & Impact Assessment

☐ Affects behavior
☐ Affects interfaces
☐ Affects data assumptions
☐ Affects downstream components

**Blast radius description:**

```
[Which modules / steps are affected]
```

☐ Impact is localized
☐ Rollback cost is understood

---

## 6. Alternatives Considered (Optional but Recommended)

☐ Alternatives were considered
☐ Alternatives were rejected for valid reasons

```
- Option considered:
  - Reason rejected:
```

This section prevents future re-litigation of the same decision.

---

## 7. AI Involvement Disclosure

☐ AI assisted in analysis or proposal
☐ AI assisted in execution
☐ AI was used only as a reviewer

☐ AI did not make the final decision
☐ Human owner approved the final decision

---

## 8. Validation & Evidence

☐ Tests updated
☐ Existing tests sufficient
☐ Manual validation performed

Evidence:

```
- Test results:
- Validation notes:
```

☐ Validation supports the decision’s safety

---

## 9. Decision Status

☐ Accepted
☐ Time-boxed (to be revisited)
☐ Superseded (link to newer decision)

If time-boxed, review date:

```
[Date]
```

---

## 10. Acknowledgment

☐ This decision is intentional and documented
☐ Future changes must explicitly revisit this decision

* **Decision Owner:**
* **Reviewer(s):**
* **Date:**

# Appendix

## How This Fits the Governance System

* **AI Sprint Scope Contract** → *What AI is allowed to do*
* **Decision Log** → *What we decided and why*
* **One-Page AI Review Checklist** → *What happened and can we defend it*

Each artifact answers a **different question**.
None overlap. None are redundant.

---

## When NOT to Use This Log (Important)

Do **not** log:

* formatting changes
* refactors with no behavior change
* test additions
* documentation updates

Overuse kills signal.

---

## The Core Principle (Worth Remembering)

> **If a future engineer might ask “why is it this way?”, log the decision.**

That’s it.
