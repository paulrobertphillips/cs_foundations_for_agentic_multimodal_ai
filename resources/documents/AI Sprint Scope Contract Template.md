# 📄 **One-Page AI Sprint Scope Contract**

> **Purpose**
> This document defines how AI may be used in this sprint, what is explicitly allowed, and where hard boundaries exist.
> It is completed **before work begins** and enforced throughout the sprint.

## 1. Sprint Identification

* **Project / Repository:**
* **Sprint Name / ID:**
* **Sprint Dates:**
* **Primary Human Owner:**

☐ Ownership for all outcomes in this sprint is explicitly assigned to a human.

---

## 2. Sprint Intent (Why This Sprint Exists)

**Sprint Goal (outcome-focused):**

```
[Brief description of what this sprint aims to accomplish and why]
```

☐ The goal is specific and bounded
☐ The goal does not imply architectural change unless explicitly stated
☐ Success can be evaluated at the end of the sprint

---

## 3. AI Role Declaration

**AI is used in this sprint as:**

☐ Planning assistant
☐ Execution assistant
☐ Refactoring assistant
☐ Reviewer / analyzer
☐ Documentation helper

☐ Roles not checked above are explicitly forbidden
☐ AI is not the owner of decisions or outcomes

---

## 4. Scope Boundaries

### AI Is Allowed to:

☐ Perform only the tasks listed below
☐ Operate strictly within defined scope

```

- …
- …
```

---

### AI Is Explicitly NOT Allowed to:

☐ Perform any task listed below
☐ Expand scope implicitly

```
- …
- …
- …
```

☐ Any violation of “NOT allowed” invalidates the sprint outcome

---

## 5. Risk & Blast Radius Assessment

☐ Changes are localized and reversible
☐ Blast radius is limited to a single module / function / pipeline step
☐ No high-risk production decision logic is involved

If risk is elevated, describe mitigation:

```
[Optional: brief note]
```

---

## 6. Approval & Review Thresholds

☐ Single engineer review sufficient
☐ Peer review required
☐ Designated owner sign-off required

☐ Review threshold matches the risk profile of this sprint

---

## 7. Validation Expectations

☐ Existing tests must pass unchanged
☐ New tests required for this sprint
☐ Manual validation required

Expected validation evidence:

```
- …
- …
```

---

## 8. Accountability Confirmation

* **Human Owner:**
* **Reviewer(s):**
* **Final Approver:**

☐ Human owner retains full responsibility for outcomes
☐ AI assistance does not transfer accountability

---

## 9. Scope Contract Acknowledgment

☐ AI is treated as a tool, not an autonomous actor
☐ Scope boundaries above are enforced throughout the sprint
☐ Any out-of-scope work requires explicit re-approval

**Acknowledged by:**
**Date:**
