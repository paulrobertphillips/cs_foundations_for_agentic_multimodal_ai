# 🧪 **Module 2.3 — Mini-Exercise**

## Task Context (given)

You are building a **data science pipeline** that will *eventually* include:

* ingestion
* cleaning
* feature engineering
* modeling
* evaluation

You are **not** building all of this now.

## 🎯 Your Task

Define **one sprint-sized AI task** by writing:

1. **Sprint Goal** (1–2 sentences)
2. **In Scope** (bullet list)
3. **Out of Scope** (bullet list)
4. **Acceptance Criteria** (3–5 bullet points)

## 📝 Submission Format (use exactly this)

**Out of Scope**

**Acceptance Criteria**

## What I’ll Review For

When you submit, I’ll check whether:

* the sprint slice is *vertical* (end-to-end usable)
* boundaries are explicit and enforceable
* acceptance criteria are objective
* the scope is realistic for one iteration
* the task is safe to give to AI without supervision drift

Once reviewed, we’ll move straight into **Module 2.4 — Refactoring with AI (Safe vs Dangerous)**.

Take your time — clarity here pays dividends later.
