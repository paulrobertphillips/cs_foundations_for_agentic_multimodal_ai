# 🧪 **Module 2.4 — Mini-Exercise**

Remember: this exercise is about **controlling change**, not producing code.

## Task Context (given)

You have a **working** data ingestion + schema validation step:

* it passes tests
* it is already approved by stakeholders
* it will be extended later with cleaning and feature engineering

Your goal is to **refactor safely**, without changing behavior or scope.

---

## 🎯 Your Task

Write **two prompts**:

---

### **Prompt A — Refactor Planning Prompt**

Must:

* forbid writing code
* explain the *intent* of the refactor
* list explicit constraints
* require an explanation of **what will NOT change**
* require a structured refactor plan

---

### **Prompt B — Refactor Execution Prompt**

Must:

* reference the approved refactor plan
* forbid behavior changes
* forbid architectural changes
* specify the exact deliverable format

---

## 📝 Submission Format

Please reply with:


**Refactor Planning Prompt**

```

**Refactor Execution Prompt**
```

```

## What I’ll Review For

I’ll check that:

* the refactor is sprint-safe
* scope is locked
* interfaces are protected
* AI is forced into explanation before action
* the execution prompt cannot silently change behavior

When you submit, I’ll give targeted feedback and refinements — then we’ll move on to **Module 2.5 — Review, Validation, and Trust-Building**.

Take your time — this is one of the most important exercises in the entire curriculum.
