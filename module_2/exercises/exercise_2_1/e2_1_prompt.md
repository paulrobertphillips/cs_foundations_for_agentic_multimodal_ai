# 🧪 **Module 2.1 — Mini-Exercise**

## 🎯 Goal

Practice rewriting a vague prompt into a **structured, junior-engineer-style prompt**.

You are *not* solving the data science problem yet — you’re practicing **how to communicate intent**.

---

## 🔹 Original Prompt (given)

```
Create a Python solution to analyze a dataset.
```

---

## 🔹 Your Task

Rewrite the prompt so that it explicitly includes:

1. **A role** for the AI
2. **A clear goal**
3. **At least 3 constraints**
4. A **plan-first instruction**
5. A **clear deliverable**

You don’t need to mention BFS, DFS, or agents yet — keep it grounded in everyday data science work.

## 🧠 What I’ll Look For When Reviewing

I’ll check whether:

* the scope is unambiguous
* the AI is told *how* to think before *what* to do
* constraints prevent over-engineering
* the deliverable is something you could realistically review in a sprint

Once you submit, I’ll:

* give targeted feedback
* suggest 1–2 optional refinements
* then we’ll move straight into **Module 2.2 — Separating Planning from Execution**

Take your time — clarity here pays off for *every* module that follows.
