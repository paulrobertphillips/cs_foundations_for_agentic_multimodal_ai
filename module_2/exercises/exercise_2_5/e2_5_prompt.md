Perfect — let’s lock this in and close out **Module 2** cleanly.
This mini-exercise is about **turning AI-assisted work into something you can confidently ship and defend**.

# 🧪 **Module 2.5 — Mini-Exercise**

## Task Context (given)

You just completed a **safe refactor** of a data ingestion + schema validation step using AI:

* Functionality is unchanged
* Tests passed unchanged
* The refactor improved readability and maintainability
* No architectural changes were made

Now you need to **review the work** and **communicate it to stakeholders**.

---

## 🎯 Your Task

Produce **two short artifacts**.

---

### **A) Review Checklist Summary**

Write **3–5 bullet points** that confirm:

* scope adherence
* behavior preservation
* interface stability
* any remaining risk (or explicitly state “low risk”)

This should read like a concise internal review note.

---

### **B) Stakeholder Update**

Write **3–5 sentences** that:

* explain what was done
* explain what was *not* done
* communicate confidence level and risk
* avoid AI jargon entirely

This should sound appropriate for:

* a sprint update
* a PR description
* a project status email

## What I’ll Review For

I’ll check that:

* the review is objective and defensible
* risk is acknowledged (not ignored)
* scope boundaries are clear
* the stakeholder message builds trust without hype

Once we complete this:

* **Module 2 is officially complete**
* We’ll do a brief **Module 2 wrap-up**
* Then we’ll move into **Module 3 — Managing AI-Driven Projects at Scale**

Take your time — clarity beats cleverness here.
