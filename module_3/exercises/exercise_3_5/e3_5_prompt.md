# 🧪 **Module 3.5 — Mini-Exercise: Governance Without Bureaucracy**

## Your Task

Define **5 lightweight project rules** for AI usage.

These rules should:

* Be **1 sentence each**
* Be **easy to remember**
* Reduce ambiguity (especially *before* work starts)
* Require **no meetings, no committees, no extra process**
* Align with everything you’ve built in Modules 3.1–3.4

Think of these as:

> *Guardrails that prevent serious mistakes, not rules that optimize productivity.*

---

## Constraints (Important)

* Do **not** explain or justify the rules
* Do **not** reference tools, prompts, or models
* Do **not** write policies or procedures
* Write them as **standing project rules**, not sprint-specific ones

Each rule should be enforceable by *reading code + artifacts*, not by interpretation.

## What I’ll Review For

I’ll be looking for:

* Clarity over completeness
* Correct handling of **ownership vs assistance**
* Explicit boundaries around **high-risk decisions**
* Consistency with your Sprint Scope Contract, Review Checklist, and Decision Log
* Whether these rules would actually be followed by a real team

There is **no single “correct” set** — this is about judgment and taste.

When you’re ready, go ahead and submit your **5 project rules for AI usage**, and we’ll do a final review to wrap up Module 3 cleanly.
