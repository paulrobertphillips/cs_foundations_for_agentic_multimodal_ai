## Module 3 Capstone — Step-by-Step Plan

### Next: **Step 3 — Risk Accumulation Analysis**

Now we zoom out across **all three sprints** and ask:

> “What could quietly go wrong over time, even if each sprint is individually safe?”

### Your output for Step 3 should include **two risks**, using this format:

```
Risk 1:
Description:
Where it first appears (Sprint X):
Why it could accumulate:
Mitigation:

Risk 2:
Description:
Where it first appears (Sprint X):
Why it could accumulate:
Mitigation:
```

Focus on:

* assumption drift
* silent coupling
* overconfidence
* test gaps
* stakeholder misunderstanding

Whenever you’re ready, submit **Step 3**.
