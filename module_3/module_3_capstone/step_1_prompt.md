## Module 3 Capstone — Step-by-Step Plan

We’ll do **5 steps** (each maps to one deliverable). You’ll write a small piece each step, I’ll review, then we’ll proceed.

### Step 1 (Now): Define the 3-sprint plan skeleton

We’ll start by naming the three sprints and giving each a crisp goal + type.

**Your output for Step 1 should include only:**

* Sprint 1: goal + type
* Sprint 2: goal + type
* Sprint 3: goal + type

Use this format:

```
Sprint 1:
Type: (feature / refactor / stabilization / mixed)
Goal:

Sprint 2:
Type:
Goal:

Sprint 3:
Type:
Goal:
```

### Guardrails for Step 1

* At least **one sprint is behavior-changing** (new capability)
* At least **one sprint is refactor or stabilization**
* The sequence should make sense: build → harden → stabilize (or similar)

### Example (don’t copy—just to show “crispness”)

* Sprint 1 (feature): implement ingestion + schema validation for one dataset
* Sprint 2 (feature): add missing-value strategy for one column + tests
* Sprint 3 (stabilization): document invariants + add tests for silent failure modes

### ✅ Your turn: Step 1

Draft your **three sprint goals + types** using the exact format above.
