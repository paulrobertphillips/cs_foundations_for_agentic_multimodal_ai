Extra Review Required When:
- The solution becomes more difficult to describe.
- Planning work priorities for future sprints becomes difficult to decide on (example: another iteration of refactoring for current pipeline stage versus beginning work for the next pipeline stage).

Stabilization Sprint Triggered When:
- Debugging prompts are required to be used more frequently following refactoring sprints.
- Older unit tests are no longer passing.
- Confidence in solution has decreased.

AI Usage Escalation / Constraint When:
- Planned refactoring sprints are no longer effective (e.g., refactoring introduces more issues & complexities than without).
- Sprints are introducing new silent failure modes into solution.
- Unexpected code changes occurred outside of plans across sprints.
