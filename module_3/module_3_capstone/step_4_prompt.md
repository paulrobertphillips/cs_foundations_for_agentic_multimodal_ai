## Module 3 Capstone — Step-by-Step Plan

### Step 4 — Governance & Escalation Points

Now we answer:

> “How do we know when this plan is no longer safe, and what do we do then?”

### Your output for Step 4 should cover:

* What changes require **extra review**
* What signals trigger a **stabilization sprint**
* When AI usage should be **paused or further constrained**

Use this format:

```
Extra Review Required When:
- …

Stabilization Sprint Triggered When:
- …

AI Usage Escalation / Constraint When:
- …
```

Think in terms of **signals**, not policies:

* test failures
* unexpected data behavior
* growing uncertainty
* stakeholder discomfort

Whenever you’re ready, submit **Step 4**.
