How stakeholders will be updated after each sprint:
- Sprint 1: This sprint will focus on improving the financial dataset's feature structuring, which is required for optimal modeling performance in downstream dependent stages. 
- Sprint 2: This sprint will focus on scaling the feature engineering solution developed by improving its maintainability.
- Sprint 3: This sprint will focus on evaluating solution stability after having implemented and scaled the financial dataset's feature structuring.

How AI involvement will be framed:
- Sprint 1: AI will be used to develop the feature engineering logic under the constraints of following a strict, human-defined fixed schema.
- Sprint 2: AI will be used to improving the code structure & documentation.
- Sprint 3: AI will review current solution state with focus on documentation, invariants, tests, and simplification.

How confidence and accountability will be preserved:
- Sprint 1: Outcome of sprint results in all unit tests passing, no unexpected (unplanned) code changes occur, and solution is explainable.
- Sprint 2: Outcome of sprint results in no functional changes being made, all unit tests passing, and engineers have reviewed and approved what has been changed.
- Sprint 3: Outcome of sprint results in clear understanding of how the current solution functionally behaves both within a single pipeline stages as well as data contracts across pipeline stages.
