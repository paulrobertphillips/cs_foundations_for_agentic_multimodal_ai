# 🧠 **Module 3 Capstone — AI-Assisted Project Leadership**

## 🎯 Capstone Goal

Design a **multi-sprint AI-assisted project plan** that demonstrates:

* clear boundaries for AI usage
* explicit risk management across time
* lightweight governance (no bureaucracy)
* stakeholder-ready communication
* clear escalation points when risk increases

This is not about writing code.
This is about **designing the conditions under which AI-driven work remains safe, explainable, and trusted**.

---

## 🧩 Scenario (Given)

You are leading a **data science / analytics project** that will evolve over several sprints.

High-level project objective (fixed):

> Build a data-driven system that supports decision-making using structured datasets, with the expectation that the solution will eventually be extended, maintained, and reviewed by others.

Constraints:

* AI assistance is allowed, but **humans retain ownership**
* The system will grow across multiple sprints
* Stakeholders expect regular updates
* Some decisions will be hard to reverse

You are responsible for designing the **project structure**, not implementing it.

---

## 🧠 Your Deliverables

You will produce **five artifacts**, each lightweight but precise.

---

### **1️⃣ Multi-Sprint Plan (3 Sprints)**

Define **three consecutive sprints**, each with:

* Sprint goal (1–2 sentences)
* Type of work (feature, refactor, stabilization, etc.)
* AI role(s) allowed
* Why this sprint is safe for AI involvement

**Guidance**

* At least one sprint should be **behavior-changing**
* At least one sprint should be **non-behavioral (refactor or stabilization)**
* Sprints should show *intentional sequencing*, not a random backlog

---

### **2️⃣ AI Boundaries Per Sprint**

For each sprint, clearly specify:

* What AI **is allowed** to do
* What AI **is forbidden** from doing
* Who owns final decisions

This should mirror the **AI Sprint Scope Contract** mindset, but at a higher level.

---

### **3️⃣ Risk Accumulation Analysis**

Identify **two risks** that could emerge *across* the three sprints.

For each risk:

* Explain how it could accumulate
* Identify the sprint where it first appears
* Propose one mitigation (lightweight, realistic)

This should explicitly reflect **Module 3.3 thinking**.

---

### **4️⃣ Governance & Escalation Points**

Define:

* What kinds of changes require **extra review**
* What signals trigger a **stabilization sprint**
* When AI usage would need to be paused or constrained further

This is about **judgment**, not policy.

---

### **5️⃣ Stakeholder Communication Plan**

Describe:

* What stakeholders will be told **each sprint**
* How AI involvement will be framed
* How confidence and accountability will be preserved

You do **not** need to write the full updates — just outline the strategy.

## ✅ What I’ll Be Evaluating

I’ll be looking for:

* internal consistency (rules match actions)
* realistic leadership judgment
* clear ownership boundaries
* proportional risk controls
* alignment with Modules 3.1–3.5
* whether this plan could actually be used by a real team

There is **no single “correct” plan** — this is about *quality of reasoning*, not answers.

---

## 🧠 Why This Capstone Matters

If Modules 0–2 were about:

* *how to work with AI*

And Module 3 was about:

* *how to manage AI safely*

Then this capstone is about:

> **how to lead AI-assisted work responsibly.**

Completing it means you’re operating at:

* senior IC level
* tech lead level
* or early staff/leadership level

depending on context.

---

### How We Can Proceed

If you want, we can:

* walk through this **step-by-step**, like earlier capstones
* start with **Sprint 1 only**, review it, then layer on others
* or you can draft the full submission and I’ll review holistically

Just tell me how you’d like to approach the Module 3 Capstone.
