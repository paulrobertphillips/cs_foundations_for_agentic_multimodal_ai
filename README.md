# CS Foundations for AI

**Computer Science Foundations for Agentic & Multimodal AI Systems**

---

## Why This Repo Exists

Modern AI systems are no longer just models.

They are **software systems** that:
- plan
- reason
- orchestrate tools
- manage workflows
- move data across APIs
- operate asynchronously
- interact with humans in the loop

Yet many practitioners working with AI are expected to build these systems **without a clear computer science foundation** tailored to how AI systems actually behave.

This repository exists to close that gap.

**CS Foundations for AI** provides a *focused, practical computer science foundation* for understanding, building, and reasoning about **agentic and multimodal AI systems** — without requiring a traditional CS degree or deep theoretical specialization.

The goal is not academic completeness.

The goal is **systems literacy**.

## Who This Is For

This repository is designed for:

- Data scientists
- AI / ML engineers
- Applied researchers
- Software engineers working with AI systems
- Practitioners transitioning into agentic or multimodal AI

If you can already write Python, but want to better understand:
- how AI systems plan and act
- why certain data structures and algorithms keep reappearing
- how agents orchestrate tools and workflows
- how AI-driven development should be managed responsibly

This repo is for you.

## What This Repository Is (and Is Not)

### ✅ This Repository Is:
- A **CS foundation tailored specifically to AI systems**
- Focused on *how AI software behaves*, not generic CS theory
- Practical, example-driven, and systems-oriented
- Designed to work alongside **AI-assisted development**
- Structured as a progressive lesson plan

### ❌ This Repository Is Not:
- A full computer science degree
- A prompt engineering guide
- A deep algorithms textbook
- A framework-specific tutorial
- A replacement for production engineering knowledge

(That last one is covered in `production-foundations-for-ai`.)

---

## Prerequisites

This material assumes:
- basic Python proficiency
- familiarity with data or ML workflows
- curiosity about how AI systems actually work under the hood

No formal CS background is required.

---

## How This Repository Is Structured

The content is organized as a **guided curriculum**, aligned with *CS Foundations for AI Lesson Plan*.

### Core Areas Covered
- Python for scalable, readable AI systems
- Algorithmic thinking (only what agents actually use)
- Task graphs, trees, and planning structures
- Human–AI collaboration and prompt orchestration
- Managing AI-driven development in agile environments
- Software design patterns relevant to AI agents
- Data structures common in agent workflows
- Concurrency and asynchronous execution
- API literacy and tool integration
- Function calling and structured outputs
- Multimodal data handling
- Agent planning loops and orchestration patterns

Each topic focuses on:
- *why it matters for AI systems*
- *how it appears in practice*
- *what level of understanding is sufficient*

## Key Design Philosophy

### 1. Foundations, Not Frameworks
Frameworks change.  
Concepts persist.

This repository focuses on the **ideas** that underlie agentic and multimodal AI systems, not any single tool or library.

---

### 2. Just Enough Computer Science
You do not need every algorithm.

You need the *right* ones:
- graphs
- trees
- search
- recursion
- queues
- async workflows

This material is intentionally selective.

---

### 3. AI as a Collaborator, Not a Crutch
AI is treated as:
- a coding assistant
- a reviewer
- a planning partner

…but never as a substitute for understanding.

You’ll learn how to **work with AI systems**, not just use them.

---

## What You’ll Be Able to Do After This

By the end of this material, you should be able to:

- reason about how agentic AI systems plan and act
- design clean, modular AI-driven codebases
- choose appropriate data structures and algorithms
- manage AI-assisted development responsibly
- understand concurrency and async behavior in agents
- integrate tools and APIs safely
- explain system behavior to collaborators and stakeholders

---

## How This Repo Fits Into the Bigger Picture

This repository pairs directly with:

- **`production-foundations-for-ai`**  
  → deploying, operating, and protecting AI systems

Together, they form a cohesive path:
> **CS foundations → production-ready AI systems**

---

## Final Note

You do not need to become a computer scientist to build AI systems.

But you *do* need computer science intuition.

This repository exists to give you exactly that — no more, no less.
