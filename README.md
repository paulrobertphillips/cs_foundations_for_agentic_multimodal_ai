# cs_foundations_for_agentic_multimodal_ai
This repository is comprised of a targeted, practical lesson plan that teaches just enough CS needed to comfortably work with agentic and multimodal AI systems as a data scientist. It's intended to be a "bridge curriculum" for those transitioning into use of AI for data science. The content is a mix of generative AI content and personal notes.
